Executable Name: ./prolog

Program Functionality:
	Works with all input formats in handout
		-like [filename] or ./prolog < filename or as a shell with just ./prolog
		-Note, program will continue running after loading in [filename] in case you want to perform more queries
	
	Works for all queries that do NOT contain a variable
		-Can still work with rules that contain variables


Bugs:
	Does not work for queries that contain a variable
		-Unfortunately didnt have the time to implement this
		-I mistakenly used plain C instead of C++ which really made it more time consuming than it should have been


Please let me know if you need me to change anything to make testing my code easier.

Thanks,
Mikey
